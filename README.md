# Student Management System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Student Management System** is a simple desktop application built with **Python Tkinter** that allows users to **insert student records**, **view registered students**, and **visualize gender distribution** using a **pie chart**.

## 🛠️ Features
- **Add Students**: Users can insert student records with essential details.
- **View Students**: Display all registered students in a list.
- **Visualize Gender Distribution**: Generate a pie chart showing the count of male and female students.
- **Error Handling**: Displays appropriate messages using `messagebox` for missing data or errors.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Core Language)
- **Tkinter** (GUI Development)
- **SQLite3** (Database Management)
- **Matplotlib** (Data Visualization)

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Student-Management-System.git
   cd Student-Management-System
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
   ```sh
   pip install matplotlib
   ```
   *(Tkinter and SQLite3 come pre-installed with Python)*
3. **Run the Application**
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## 📊 How It Works
1. **Register a student** by entering details and clicking the **Submit** button.
2. Click on **Show Students** to view all registered students.
3. Click **Visualize Gender Distribution** to see a pie chart of male and female students.
4. If no students are registered, a warning message will appear.
